Golden Rules
============

Be Consistent
-------------

Why?

* Programming is codified thought
* C++ is difficult because it offers severals ways of doing the same thing and we all think differently
* The best code is written by people who rigurously follow coding and consistency standards
* Use clang-format to enforce coding styles

Be Readable
-----------

Why?

* Anyone can write code that a compiler understands, good programmers write code that humans understand
* The time to learn and debug a code matters.  Code that others can't read or debug is usually rewritten by others
* Code that does something "clever" does not scale because what is clever to one is not obvious to another

Be Debuggable
-------------

* Strive to make code easy to debug with good variable names and conditions that make setting breakpoints easy
