================

My name is Charles.  I've been programming in C++ since 1995.  It was the first programming language I learned and the default language I use to to get stuff done.  I've seen a lot of good C++ code in my life.  I've watches C++ mature into a great programming language and I've seen new generations tackle the ever-so-complex language.  Even though I learned C, Java, C# and Python along the way, I always seem to go back to C++.
